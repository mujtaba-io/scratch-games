Scratch 3 games that I made.

## Avoid the Witch

Here we have multiple levels and enemy (witch) is moving in random directions. We need to eat the collectable item and avoid hitting the witch to get our score increased and level completed.

## Cool 3 Parts Game

It is a step-by-step game, in which we need to make a player, a villian, and collectable items. We also make health and things that reduce health when we hit them. I have also used background music and other sounds.
There are 2 levels, and level 2 is more difficult with an animated enemy ninja sprite. Some of the assets are my own and some are taken from opengameart.org under CC0 license.

## Reach the Treasure

This game is has an animated character (with proper walk animation), and the player needs to cross the bridge to reach the treasure. On reaching the treasure, the chest-box will open.
